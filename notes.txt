Three pillars of JavaScript
1. Types and Coercion
2. Scope and Closures
3. This keyword and Prototypes

statement: var age = 38;
expression: age = 38
age = 1 + (age * 2);
expressions: age, 2, (age * 2), 1, 1 + (age * 2)

/// Three Pillars of JavaScript
// 1. Types and Coercion
// ---------------------
// Primitive Types, Converting Types, Checking Equality
//Primitive Types
// In JS, everything is an Object = False
// Undefined, String, number, boolean, object, symbol
// JS variables do not have types, values do

Use New on Object(), Array(), Function(), Date(), RefExp(), Error()
Do Not use new on String(), Number(), Boolean()

// Coercion = The way to convert from one type to another

// 2. Scope and Closures
// ---------------------

// 3. This keyword and Prototypes
// ------------------------------
